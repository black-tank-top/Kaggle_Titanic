# Kaggle-Taitanic

Example code for solving the [Titanic prediction problem](https://www.kaggle.com/c/titanic-gettingStarted) on Kaggle.

## Introduction

This code is my first stab at a Kaggle. The notebook is written in python and Iâ€™ll then compare some classifiers in scikit-learn.


## Features

There are three parts to my script as follows:

1. Feature engineering
2. Data cleaning (Missing value imputation and maping features into numerical values)
3. Classifier comparison
4. Prediction

## Requirement

- Anaconda3-4.2.0

## Installation

    $ git clone https://github.com/black-tank-top/Kaggle_Titanic.git
